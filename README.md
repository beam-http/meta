# beam-http

## mission statement

bringing together individuals with an interest in a healthy http ecosystem
on the beam vm so they can collaborate, coordinate and cooperate

## short term goals

* identify gaps and weaknesses in the current http ecosystem and locate
  potential contributors able and willing to help
* increase redundancy both in contributors and code so that if any given
  project or individual goes inactive there is an obvious path forward for the
  community
* increase visibility of ongoing development efforts to reduce duplication of
  effort and to encourage outside contributions
* discuss *potential* interop standards (in a very informal manner, the world
  does not need another spec)

## long term goals

* a healthy ecosystem that no longer needs beam-http

## what's expected of members

nothing. it'd be nice if you subscribed to the meta repo and occaisonally
browsed issues or pull requests, but all that's required is that members want
to work together to help move things forward

## what we're not

an effort to produce one ultimate http client/server/library. a healthy
ecosystem will have multiple clients, multiple servers and multiple libraries
